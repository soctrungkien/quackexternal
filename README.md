# Quack External

A Roblox external script executor written in C++. Operates entirely outside the Roblox process — no DLL injection, no driver.

## How it works

Quack attaches to a running Roblox process from the outside. It locates the Lua state through the TaskScheduler, elevates thread identity to 8, injects a signed Luau bytecode payload via a hijacked CoreScript slot (CollisionMatchers2D → JestModule), and exposes a standard executor API surface to user scripts.

Communication between the injected Lua payload and the host process goes through a local HTTP bridge (`localhost:6767`) and a WebSocket server (`localhost:8080`).

## Building

Requires Visual Studio 2022 (v143 toolset), Windows SDK, x64.

```
MSBuild Quack.sln /p:Configuration=Release /p:Platform=x64
```

Output: `Quack/build/Quack.exe`

## Compatibility

Currently supports Roblox version `version-2e6461290a3541f5`. Offsets are in `Quack/Source/Update/Offsets.hpp` and can be refreshed remotely via `Offsets::RefreshFromRemote()`.

SUNC (Standard UNC) compatibility is a primary goal of the Lua payload.

## Attribution

The following Lua API functions were rewritten with reference to `External-Executor-Module` by Vexo6967:
`setscriptbytecode`, `keypress`, `keyrelease`, `newlclosure`, and the registry-based `getgc` behavior.
